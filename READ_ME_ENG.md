This program in the VB programming language demonstrates the solution of a complex mathematical example z_1 = √ (√ (5 & (2b + 1) ^ 3) -64b) / (√5b + (3√b) / 2); z_2 = √2b
using the VB language.
The main module Module1 contains a single main function: Sub Main () is a completely decisive mathematical example.
